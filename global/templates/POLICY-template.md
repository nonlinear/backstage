## Universal Workflow

**This project follows the [global backstage policy](global/POLICY.md)** for:

- Epic/branch workflow ("Epic Dance")
- Semantic versioning
- Branch strategy
- Commit messages
- Rebase vs merge rules
- Pre-commit workflow

**This file contains only project-specific rules and deviations.**

## Epic Format Extensions

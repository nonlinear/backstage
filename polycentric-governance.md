# Polycentric Governance in Backstage

Backstage follows a **polycentric structure**—not hierarchical "levels" but **overlapping jurisdictions** where global and project concerns coexist.

**Inspired by Elinor Ostrom's work on commons management.**

Commons thrive under polycentric governance because:

1. **Local knowledge matters** - Your project's constraints aren't in any global rulebook
2. **Flexibility beats rigidity** - Adapt patterns instead of forcing compliance
3. **Innovation happens everywhere** - Best practices emerge from experiments, not mandates

## Key Principles

1. **Multiple centers of power:** Global backstage defines framework, projects adapt to context
2. **Overlapping not separate:** Project POLICY.md **extends** (not replaces) global/POLICY.md
3. **Self-organized correction:** When backstage updates, projects decide whether/when to adopt
4. **No top-down mandates:** Global provides patterns, projects choose implementations

**Example:** Epic format syntax lives in global/POLICY.md, but Librarian's "requires reindexing?" column lives in project POLICY.md. Both valid simultaneously.

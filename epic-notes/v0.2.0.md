## Session Log

### 2026-01-28 - Epic Start & Systematic Renaming

**Completed:**

- ✅ Created branch v0.2.0 (simplified from v0.2.0-rebrand-admin per new naming policy)
- ✅ Updated global/POLICY.md: Branch naming = version only (v0.X.0)
- ✅ Renamed prompts: backstage-start.prompt.md
- ✅ Renamed update script: global/update-backstage.py
- ✅ Updated README.md: All MGMT → backstage references
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md: Title and references
- ✅ Updated ROADMAP.md: Title, epic description, all tasks
- ✅ Updated CHECKS.md: Title, all test descriptions
- ✅ Updated POLICY.md and global/POLICY.md: References and folder paths

**In progress:**

- User renaming repo on GitHub (nonlinear/MGMT → nonlinear/backstage)

**Next steps:**

- Update git remote URL after repo rename
- Test all checks pass
- Commit all changes
- Continue with navigation logic documentation tasks

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:**

- Final name choice: "backstage" (theater metaphor, producer vs. consumer)
- Branch naming simplified to version-only per updated global/POLICY.md
- 12 total tasks: 6 rebranding + 6 navigation logic

## Decisions

**2026-01-28:** Name = "backstage"

- Rejected: "MGMT" (too generic), "admin" (boring), "staff" (good but less evocative)
- Chosen: "backstage" for rich theater metaphor and cultural resonance
- "Backstage pass" = universal insider access metaphor

**2026-01-28:** Branch naming = version only

- Format: v0.X.0 (no descriptive suffixes)
- Updated global/POLICY.md to codify this standard

---

## Discoveries

- The workspace never had a MGMT/ folder - status files live at root with global/ subfolder
- update-MGMT.py already existed as update-backstage.py after rename
- backstage-start.prompt.md successfully renamed from MGMT-start.prompt.md

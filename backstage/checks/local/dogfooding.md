# Dogfooding - Backstage Uses Backstage

**We eat our own dog food.**

**What this means:**
- Root `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `POLICY.md`, `HEALTH.md` = backstage project status
- `backstage/global/` = framework code (shared by all projects)
- We follow our own rules (epic dance, navigation blocks, health checks)

**Dual-layer structure:**
- `backstage/` = framework we're building
- Root files = us using that framework

**See HEALTH.md for dogfooding-specific checks.**
